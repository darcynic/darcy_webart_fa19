<h1><font color = #6B8E23 size=+9> â€œThe idea was to re-politicize the net, in a sense. The net does run on servers, and on power. And those things actually occupy space. Therefore, it kind of conforms to the politics of those spaces.â€â€¨- Charles Lim Yi Yong </font></h1>

<h6> <font color = #DDA0DD size = "+13">I'm gaining a really unique perspective on the world. Because those national systems of images are so big, it's really hard to deconstruct them. One of the only ways you can really get a view on them is to travel and leave them, see their limits.<h6/>

    <h7><p><font color = #20B2AA> <i>In a weird way Kai Altmann and Charles Lim Yi Yong are very linked in what they are exploring through their art, one main way is by travel,,, Kai Altmann considers themselves a digital nomad constantly moving while also being involved online, and Charles Lim Yi Yong wanted to traverse land while also being online the whole time
        Also both are interested in non western ways of approaching the internet and how non western world countries are involved with the web</i></a></h7>
